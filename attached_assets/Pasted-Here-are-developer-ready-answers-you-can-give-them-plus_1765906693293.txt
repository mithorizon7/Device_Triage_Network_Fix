Here are developer-ready answers you can give them (plus a couple “do it this way” directives so you don’t get stuck in endless re-clarifying).

1) Device roster source

Answer: Use the same scenario JSON format/structure as the Cartographer.
Directive: Build App 4 to consume the shared Scenario schema, but only rely on a subset of fields.

Why: You want one “source of truth” for story networks across apps. It keeps content authoring sane and lets you reuse scenarios.

Implementation notes for dev

App 4 should accept:

networks[] (zones + SSIDs + security state)

devices[] (type, label, networkId, riskFlags)

optional learningPrompts[] (for embedded checks)

It should ignore any extra fields the Cartographer needs (positions, animations, etc.)

It must run entirely offline/sandbox-safe; no uploads, no pasted data.

2) Scoring system specifics

Answer: You should design a reasonable scoring model using security best practices, but make it fully configurable via JSON so we can tune it without touching code.

Directive: Implement scoring as a transparent rules engine, not hardcoded numbers.

What that means

A scoringRules.json file defines:

zone assignment impacts

control impacts

synergy/interaction rules (e.g., IoT isolation reduces risk only if guest/IoT network exists)

caps/floors so scores don’t go negative or explode

App displays an “Explain my score” panel listing the top contributors and why.

Preferred scoring UX

Show a simple meter (e.g., 0–100 risk)

Also show 3 sub-scores:

Exposure (flat network, unknown devices)

Credential/Account (MFA off, default passwords conceptually)

Hygiene (updates, strong Wi-Fi, etc.)
This prevents “one number” from oversimplifying.

Important constraint

Keep it conceptual—no step-by-step router config instructions and no offensive guidance. This is a planner, not a how-to hacking manual.

3) Number of scenarios

Answer: Start with three pre-built scenarios from day one:

Family Home (IoT sprawl) – highest relatability

Small Office – segmentation and guest Wi-Fi relevance

Hotel/Public Wi-Fi – even though it’s not “home,” it’s great for “what devices belong where” and “what actions are safe”

Directive: Build the app so scenarios are drop-in JSON files, and it auto-detects all files in /scenarios/.

Why three (not one)

One scenario feels like a toy.

Three scenarios show this is a transferable skill, not a one-off puzzle.

4) Visual style

Answer: Create a clean, professional educational interface that matches the rest of the suite, but we are not enforcing a strict external brand system right now.

Directive: Match these design principles:

Calm, “mission-control” feel (not childish)

High readability, low clutter

Clear affordances for drag/drop

Accessible: keyboard, screen-reader-friendly list mode, no color-only cues

Specific UI guidance

Two-pane layout:

Left: device roster (cards)

Right: zones (Main / Guest / IoT / Investigate)

Top: scenario selector

Bottom: risk meter + “Explain my score”

Controls drawer: toggles/checklist for high-impact controls (WPA2/WPA3, strong Wi-Fi password, guest network, isolate IoT, MFA, updates)

Aesthetic defaults

Neutral palette, restrained use of warnings (use icons + text)

Use consistent device icons (laptop, phone, camera, speaker, printer, etc.)

Animations: subtle (snap-to-zone, meter transitions), no gimmicks

Extra constraints you should add (to prevent future misunderstandings)

Tell them explicitly:

No real data in or out

No copy/paste of real device lists

No analytics

No external calls

CSP blocks outbound connections

Deterministic behavior

Given a scenario + rules file, the score must be repeatable

Add unit tests for scoring rules

Content-editable

Scenario content, copy text, and scoring rules should be editable without code changes
