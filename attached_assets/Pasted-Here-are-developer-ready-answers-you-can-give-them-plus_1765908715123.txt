Here are **developer-ready answers** you can give them (plus a couple “do it this way” directives so you don’t get stuck in endless re-clarifying).

---

## 1) Device roster source

**Answer:** Use the **same scenario JSON format/structure as the Cartographer**.
**Directive:** Build App 4 to consume the shared `Scenario` schema, but only rely on a *subset* of fields.

**Why:** You want one “source of truth” for story networks across apps. It keeps content authoring sane and lets you reuse scenarios.

**Implementation notes for dev**

* App 4 should accept:

  * `networks[]` (zones + SSIDs + security state)
  * `devices[]` (type, label, networkId, riskFlags)
  * optional `learningPrompts[]` (for embedded checks)
* It should **ignore** any extra fields the Cartographer needs (positions, animations, etc.)
* It must run entirely offline/sandbox-safe; no uploads, no pasted data.

## 2) Scoring system specifics

**Answer:** You should **design a reasonable scoring model** using security best practices, **but make it fully configurable via JSON** so we can tune it without touching code.

**Directive:** Implement scoring as a **transparent rules engine**, not hardcoded numbers.

**What that means**

* A `scoringRules.json` file defines:

  * zone assignment impacts
  * control impacts
  * synergy/interaction rules (e.g., IoT isolation reduces risk only if guest/IoT network exists)
  * caps/floors so scores don’t go negative or explode
* App displays an **“Explain my score”** panel listing the top contributors and why.

**Preferred scoring UX**

* Show a simple meter (e.g., 0–100 risk)
* Also show 3 sub-scores:

  * **Exposure** (flat network, unknown devices)
  * **Credential/Account** (MFA off, default passwords conceptually)
  * **Hygiene** (updates, strong Wi-Fi, etc.)
    This prevents “one number” from oversimplifying.

**Important constraint**

* Keep it conceptual—**no step-by-step router config instructions** and no offensive guidance. This is a planner, not a how-to hacking manual.

## 3) Number of scenarios

**Answer:** Start with **three** pre-built scenarios from day one:

1. **Family Home (IoT sprawl)** – highest relatability
2. **Small Office** – segmentation and guest Wi-Fi relevance
3. **Hotel/Public Wi-Fi** – even though it’s not “home,” it’s great for “what devices belong where” and “what actions are safe”

**Directive:** Build the app so scenarios are **drop-in JSON files**, and it auto-detects all files in `/scenarios/`.

**Why three (not one)**

* One scenario feels like a toy.
* Three scenarios show this is a transferable skill, not a one-off puzzle.

---

## 4) Visual style

**Answer:** Create a **clean, professional educational interface** that matches the rest of the suite, but we are not enforcing a strict external brand system right now.

**Directive:** Match these design principles:

* Calm, “mission-control” feel (not childish)
* High readability, low clutter
* Clear affordances for drag/drop
* Accessible: keyboard, screen-reader-friendly list mode, no color-only cues

**Specific UI guidance**

* Two-pane layout:

  * Left: device roster (cards)
  * Right: zones (Main / Guest / IoT / Investigate)
* Top: scenario selector
* Bottom: risk meter + “Explain my score”
* Controls drawer: toggles/checklist for high-impact controls (WPA2/WPA3, strong Wi-Fi password, guest network, isolate IoT, MFA, updates)

**Aesthetic defaults**

* Neutral palette, restrained use of warnings (use icons + text)
* Use consistent device icons (laptop, phone, camera, speaker, printer, etc.)
* Animations: subtle (snap-to-zone, meter transitions), no gimmicks

---

## Extra constraints you should add (to prevent future misunderstandings)

Tell them explicitly:

1. **No real data in or out**

* No copy/paste of real device lists
* No analytics
* No external calls
* CSP blocks outbound connections

2. **Deterministic behavior**

* Given a scenario + rules file, the score must be repeatable
* Add unit tests for scoring rules

3. **Content-editable**

* Scenario content, copy text, and scoring rules should be editable without code changes

---

## The message you can send the dev (copy/paste)

Use the same scenario JSON schema as the Cartographer. App 4 should consume a subset (networks/devices/riskFlags) and ignore visualization-only fields.

For scoring: design a reasonable model based on best practices, but implement it as a transparent rules engine driven by a configurable `scoringRules.json` (no hardcoded values). Include an “Explain my score” panel listing top contributors and why. Keep it conceptual—no step-by-step router configuration or anything offensive.

Scenarios: ship with 3 from day one (Family IoT sprawl, Small Office, Hotel/Public). Scenarios should be drop-in JSON files loaded from a `/scenarios/` folder.

Visual style: clean, professional educational UI consistent with the suite; prioritize readability and accessibility. Two-pane drag/drop (device cards → zones), scenario selector, controls drawer, and a risk meter with clear feedback. No real data collection, no analytics, no external calls; strict CSP.

**Want me to also propose a starter scoringRules.json (with conservative, explainable defaults) and a minimal scenario JSON for “Family IoT sprawl” so they can begin immediately?**
